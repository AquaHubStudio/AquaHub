[AquaHub](https://aquahub.studio) is an open source network built using [Svelte Kit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) as its frontend and [PocketBase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) as its backend. The project's goal is to enable people from all around the world to _share, discover and collaborate_ on software projects through an easy and intuitive UI.
> ⚠️ Please keep in mind that AquaHub is currently in alpha version. Many features are missing and critical bugs are expected.
