## 🛠️ Setup Development Environment

> ⚠️ We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/) and this guide is based on features of Visual Studio Code

Branch naming convention is as follows

`TYPE/ISSUE_ID-DESCRIPTION` (Example: `feature/12-create-user-page`)

`TYPE` can be:

- **feature** - is a new feature
- **docs** - documentation only changes
- **bug** - a bug fix
- **refactor** - code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

For the initial start, fork the project and use git clone command to download the repository to your computer. A standard procedure for working on an issue would be to:

1. `git pull`, before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```
2. Install [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) to be able to run your devcontainer.

3. Reload your window (`CMD + Shift + P` > `"Developer: Reload Window"`). After the reload click on the button that's poping up in the right corner called `Reopen in Container`. You now started the devcontainer and it is setting everything up.

4. Create new branch from `master` like: `feature/12-create-user-page`<br/>

```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

5. Work - commit - repeat ( be sure to be in your branch )

6. If you're ready to create a **Pull Request** check out [📥 Pull Request Policy](#-pull-request-policy)
## ⚙️ Configure PocketBase (Backend)
In the Backend we use [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io). It's a *Backend-as-a-Service* that covers all our current needs for the beginning.

Still there's some stuff to configure at the start before you can start coding.
> ℹ️ PocketBase is automatically up and running after you started your devcontainer

- [Create admin user](#create-admin-user)
- [Import structure](#import-structure)
- [Configure OAuth2 provider](#configure-oauth2-provider)

### Create admin user
The **PocketBase UI** URL is [http://localhost:8090/_](http://localhost:8090/_). The first time you visit this page you see this form where you create your first (admin) user. It doesn't matter what you fill in here as long as you remember it. You just need to access the web dashboard.

### Import structure
Download `.devcontainer/db.json` to your computer. Next, import it to PocketBase as shown below. After that click on "Review" and just click "Review" again without

## 📥 Pull Request Policy

Before you finally create your **Pull Request** please follow the tasks down below.

**All PRs must include a commit message with the description of the changes made!**

1. Format your code via this command in your root directory

```bash
yarn run format
```

2. Now, in addition, run the linter and get a list of found errors or warnings. Fix all errors and as many warnings as you can.

```bash
yarn run lint
```

3. Push changes to GitHub

```
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

4. Submit your changes for review
   If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
5. Start a Pull Request
   Now submit the pull request and click on `Create pull request`.
6. Get a `code review approval/reject` and after everything's fine merge the branch
7. _GitHub will automatically delete the branch after the merge is done. (they can still be restored)._
